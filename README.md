# Excel_portfolio_projects
This repository contains all the data analysis projects which I made in excel. In these projects I used all the advanced concepts of Excel and visualise the results using charts.
I used pivot tables to summarise or aggregate the data. Some popular functions like sumif, averageif, concatenate, left, right. Text to Column feature, conditional formatting and so on.
Added new columns if required for analysis.
First and most important step is Data Cleaning.
